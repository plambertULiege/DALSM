Description: Fit of a double additive location-scale model with a nonparametric error distribution from possibly right- or interval-censored data. The additive terms in the location and dispersion submodels, as well as the unknown error distribution in the location-scale model, are estimated using Laplace P-splines. For more details, see Lambert (2021) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2021.107250>.
